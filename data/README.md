## Data Notes

- The dataset includes both **categorical** and **numerical** variables.  
- Several columns contain **missing values**, notably `race`, `weight`, `payer_code`, `medical_specialty`, and the diagnosis fields.  
- Medication-related variables represent both prescription presence and dosage changes.  
- Patients can appear multiple times if they have several encounters recorded.  
- The target variable `readmitted` represents whether a patient was readmitted within 30 days, after 30 days, or not at all.
